Developed a Face Recognition Application using React, integrating face-api.js for face detection and recognition.
Implemented webcam integration with react-webcam, enabling real-time video capture for face recognition.
Optimized performance by processing video frames at intervals and loading models asynchronously to enhance user experience.
Ensured secure handling of user data by implementing appropriate permissions for camera access and adhering to privacy regulations.
Created a user-friendly interface displaying video streams, bounding boxes around detected faces, and recognition results in real-time.
Deployed the application using [Netlify/Vercel/GitHub Pages], ensuring secure HTTPS access for webcam functionality.
Managed face data storage efficiently, allowing for dynamic addition and recognition of new faces.

Face Recognition React Project
Overview
This project is a real-time face recognition application built with React and face-api.js. It leverages the power of neural networks to detect and recognize faces from a live webcam feed.

Features
Real-time Face Detection and Recognition
Utilizes face-api.js for accurate face detection and recognition.
Processes video frames from the webcam in real-time.
Webcam Integration
Integrated using react-webcam for seamless video capture.
Displays live video feed from the user's webcam.
Interactive UI
Draws bounding boxes around detected faces.
Shows recognition results directly on the video feed.
Performance Optimizations
Loads face recognition models asynchronously.
Processes video frames at optimized intervals to reduce CPU load.
Secure and Privacy-Conscious
Requests and handles camera permissions appropriately.
Ensures secure handling and storage of face data.
Easy Deployment
Can be deployed on platforms like Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages.
Ensures HTTPS access for secure webcam functionality.
